## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

This app falls under the arcade game category of the project. It is similar
to the Snake arcade game in which users can use the keyboard arrow keys
to help a snake eat apples. Each time the snake eats an apple, 5 points is
added to the user's score. The game is over if the snake bumps into itself
or one of the walls.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

Something new I learned from this project was how to use the drawImage
method in the GraphicContexts class to draw an image in the given
destination rectangle of the canvas. This image is scaled to fit the
the destination rectangle's dimensions.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start this project over from the scratch, I would plan out
all the helper methods I need to perform certain pieces of functionality
beforehand instead of as I go because by planning it out before coding,
I can better determine if overlap exists between various methods. Overall,
this can help me write cleaner code that is also shorter.
